# Phaser Pac-Man
 
Self-Evaluation:
how many points out of 105 do you deserve on this assignment:

Max De: 70/105

Self-Reflection:
Max De - Creating the game was harder than I had expected so I had to reference a tutorial for pac-man and the ghosts movements. After referencing the tutorials I was able to createa a basic clone, but I was unable to successfully implement an API.
